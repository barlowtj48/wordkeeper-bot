# Wordkeeper Discord Bot
A game style discord bot that tracks a 'hotword' and lets users try and obtain the top score.

### How to setup
A `.env` must include your token, such as:
`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=example.token`

In the install directory run `node install`. This will install the required packages that the bot needs to run.

In a terminal of your choice then run `node server.js` to startup the bot. The stats for the bot will be stored in `data.json`.
